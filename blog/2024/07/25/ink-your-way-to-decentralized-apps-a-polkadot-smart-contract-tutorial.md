## Introduction {#introduction}

Polkadot is not just another blockchain; it's a paradigm shift in blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Polkadot envisions a future of interconnected chains, ushering in a new era of cross-chain interoperability.

Imagine a network where specialized blockchains, each optimized for specific tasks, seamlessly communicate and transact with one another. This is the essence of Polkadot.

Ready to dive into the world of decentralized applications on Polkadot? This tutorial will guide you through building your first dApp using `Ink!`, Polkadot's powerful smart contract language.

I'll walk you through every step, from writing your first smart contract to deploying it on the Polkadot network. Finally, I'll show you how to interact with your creation using a built-in UI.

Let's get started! ðŸš€

## What is Ink!? {#what-is-ink}

`Ink!` is a smart contract language developed by `Parity Technologies`. First introduced in 2018, Ink! has continued to evolve, with the latest version (as of this writing) being Ink! 5.0.

`Ink!` designed for `Substrate-based blockchains` comes with `Contract Pallet`, a runtime module that allows developers to deploy and execute smart contracts on the Polkadot network. It's based on `Rust`, a popular programming language known for its performance and safety features.

## Setting Up Your Environment {#setting-up-your-environment}

Before we start coding, we need to set up our development environment. Take it easy; it's not as complicated as it sounds. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Install Rust

You can follow the official Rust installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

For Linux or macOS, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you're using Windows, you can download the installer from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

In addition to Rust, installation requires a C++ compiler that supports C++17

```bash
rustup component add rust-src
```

Check if Rust is installed correctly by running:

```bash
rustc --version
```

### 2. Install the ink! CLI

The **ink! CLI** is a command-line tool that helps you create, build, and deploy smart contracts. You can install it using **Cargo**, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract
```

Check if the installation was successful by running:

```bash
cargo contract -V
```

### 3. Setup local Substrate Node

To easy the development process, we will use **substrate-contracts-node** which is configured to include the Contract Pallet.

There are two ways to set up a local Substrate node:

- Use released binaries (recommended): You can download the latest release from the [official repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node/releases).

- Build from source: You will need to install all required dependencies for building Substrate. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.substrate.io/install/). After that, you will run the following commands:

```bash
cargo install contracts-node
```

### 4. Install Polkadot JS Extension

The `Polkadot JS Extension` is a browser extension that allows you to interact with the Polkadot network. You can install it from the [Official Chrome Web Store](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

That's it! You're all set up and ready to start coding. ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜Ž

## Writing Your First Smart Contract - Hello world {#writing-your-first-smart-contract}

Now that we have our environment set up, let's write our first smart contract. We'll create a simple contract that stores a single value and allows us to read and update it.

### 1. Create a new project

Create a new project using the `ink! CLI`:

Open your terminal and execute the following command using the ink! CLI to initiate a new project:

```bash
cargo contract new hello_world
```

Feel free to replace `"hello_world"` with a project name of your preference.

This command will generate a new project with the following structure:

```bash
hello_world
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
```

### 2. Break down the components:

> `Cargo.toml`: This file includes the project's metadata and dependency specifications. You can enrich your project by incorporating additional dependencies here as needed. For the scope of this initial contract, we'll retain the default configuration.

Default ink! dependencies are already included in the `Cargo.toml` file. You can find them under the `[dependencies]` section.

```toml
[dependencies]
ink = { version = "5.0.0", default-features = false }
```

> `lib.rs`: Contains the code that defines its logic. We'll be focusing our efforts here to implement the desired functionality.

### 3. Implement the smart contract

Open the `lib.rs` file in your favorite code editor and clear the existing content. Replace it with the following code:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod hello_world {
    use ink::prelude::string::String;

    /// Defines the storage of your contract.
    /// Add new fields to the below struct in order
    /// to add new static storage fields to your contract.
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct HelloMessage {
        author: AccountId,
        message: String,
        count: u64,
    }

    impl HelloMessage {
        /// Constructor that initializes the `HelloMessage` struct with default values.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self {
                author: Self::env().caller(),
                message: String::from("Hello, World!"),
                count: Default::default(),
            }
        }

        /// A function that returns the current state of your contract.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> (AccountId, String, u64) {
            (self.author, self.message.clone(), self.count)
        }

        /// A function that allows the caller to set a new message.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn set(&mut self, new_message: String) {
            self.author = self.env().caller();
            self.message = new_message;
            self.count = self.count.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down the code:

- Contract is defined as a module using the `#[ink::contract]` attribute macro.

- `#[ink::contract]`: This attribute macro marks the **module** as a contract, acting as the entry point for the ink! framework. This macro works behind the scenes to generate the essential code, ensuring compatibility with the ink! ecosystem.

- `#[ink(storage)]`: This attribute macro marks the **struct** as a storage struct. It tells the ink! framework that the **struct** contains storage fields that need to be persisted on-chain. In ink!, `you can have only one struct marked with the #[ink(storage)] attribute within a single contract`. If you need multiple storage structs, you can nest them within the primary storage struct. In this case, we have some storage field:

  - `author` of type `AccountId`, which stores the address of the account that call the contract.

  - `message` of type `String`, which stores the message we want to display. To use the `String` type, we need to import it from the `ink::prelude` module using `use ink::prelude::string::String`.

  - `count` of type `u64`, which stores the number of times the message has been updated.

- `#[ink(constructor)]`: This attribute macro marks the function as a constructor. It's called when the contract is deployed and initializes the contract's storage fields with default values.

- `#[ink(message)]`: This attribute macro marks the function as a callable message. It's a function that can be called by external accounts to interact with the contract. In this contract, we have two messages:

  - `get`: Returns the current state of the contract, including the author address, message, and count.

  - `set`: Allows the caller to set a new message. It increments the count by one and updates the author every time the message is changed.

## Make some unit tests {#make-some-unit-tests}

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[ink::test]
    fn default_works() {
        let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();

        // Set the contract as callee and Alice as caller.
        let contract = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
        ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(contract);
        ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.alice);
        let hello_message = HelloMessage::default();
        assert_eq!(
            hello_message.get(),
            (accounts.alice, "Hello, World!".to_string(), 0)
        );
    }

    #[ink::test]
    fn it_works() {
        let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
        // Set the contract as callee and Alice as caller.
        let contract = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
        ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(contract);
        ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.alice);

        let mut hello_message = HelloMessage::default();
        assert_eq!(
            hello_message.get(),
            (accounts.alice, "Hello, World!".to_string(), 0)
        );

        ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.bob);

        hello_message.set("Hello, I'm Bob".to_string());
        assert_eq!(
            hello_message.get(),
            (accounts.bob, "Hello, I'm Bob".to_string(), 1)
        );
    }
}
```

Run the test using the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```

If the test passes, you should see the following output:

![Unit test result](./assets/ink-unit-test.png)

Final code:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod hello_world {
    use ink::prelude::string::String;

    /// Defines the storage of your contract.
    /// Add new fields to the below struct in order
    /// to add new static storage fields to your contract.
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct HelloMessage {
        author: AccountId,
        message: String,
        count: u64,
    }

    impl HelloMessage {
        /// Constructor that initializes the `HelloMessage` struct with default values.
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn default() -> Self {
            Self {
                author: Self::env().caller(),
                message: String::from("Hello, World!"),
                count: Default::default(),
            }
        }

        /// A function that returns the current state of your contract.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> (AccountId, String, u64) {
            (self.author, self.message.clone(), self.count)
        }

        /// A function that allows the caller to set a new message.
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn set(&mut self, new_message: String) {
            self.author = self.env().caller();
            self.message = new_message;
            self.count = self.count.checked_add(1).unwrap();
        }
    }

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[ink::test]
        fn default_works() {
            let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();

            // Set the contract as callee and Alice as caller.
            let contract = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
            ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(contract);
            ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.alice);
            let hello_message = HelloMessage::default();
            assert_eq!(
                hello_message.get(),
                (accounts.alice, "Hello, World!".to_string(), 0)
            );
        }

        #[ink::test]
        fn it_works() {
            let accounts = ink::env::test::default_accounts::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
            // Set the contract as callee and Alice as caller.
            let contract = ink::env::account_id::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>();
            ink::env::test::set_callee::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(contract);
            ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.alice);

            let mut hello_message = HelloMessage::default();
            assert_eq!(
                hello_message.get(),
                (accounts.alice, "Hello, World!".to_string(), 0)
            );
             // Set Bob as caller.
            ink::env::test::set_caller::<ink::env::DefaultEnvironment>(accounts.bob);

            hello_message.set("Hello, I'm Bob".to_string());
            assert_eq!(
                hello_message.get(),
                (accounts.bob, "Hello, I'm Bob".to_string(), 1)
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Compiling and Deploying Your Smart Contract {#compiling-and-deploying-your-smart-contract}

Now that we have our smart contract ready, let's compile and deploy it on the local Substrate node.

### 1. Compile the smart contract

Run the following command to compile the smart contract:

```bash
cargo contract build
```

If the compilation is successful, you should see the following output:

![Cargo contract build success](./assets/cargo-contract-build.png)

### 2. Deploy the smart contract on the local Substrate node

To deploy the smart contract, we need to start the local Substrate node. Navigate to the directory where you have the `substrate-contracts-node` binary and run the following command:

```bash
substrate-contracts-node
```

Once the node is up and running, you will see the following output:

![Substrate node running](./assets/substrate-node-running.png)

Open browser and navigate to [https://ui.use.ink/](https://ui.use.ink/) to access the ink! UI. A UI for deploying and interacting with ink! smart contracts.

At the top left corner, you will see a combobox to select the network. Choose `Local Node` to connect to your local Substrate node.

![connect to local node](./assets/connect-to-local-node.png)

Next, click on the `Add new contract` button to navigate to the upload contract page.
Click `Upload new contract code`, choose account what you want to deploy the contract, and select the `hello_world.contract` file in the `target/ink` directory of your project.

![init contract](./assets/init-contract.png)

Click on `Next` button, and you will see the contract details.

If you have more than one contructor, you can choose the constructor you want to deploy.

![deploy contract step 1](./assets/deploy-contract-step-1.png)

Click on the `Next` button again, after that, you will see the contract code hash and data. At this point, you need click on the `Upload and Instantiate` button to deploy the contract.

![deploy contract step 2](./assets/deploy-contract-step-2.png)

If the deployment is successful, you will see the following output:

![deploy contract success](./assets/deploy-contract-success.png)

### 3. Interacting with Your Smart Contract {#interacting-with-your-smart-contract}

Now that we have deployed our smart contract, let's interact with it using the ink! UI.

On the ink! UI, you will see the contract you just deployed. Click on the contract name button to navigate to the contract page.

At this point, you can interact with the contract by calling the `get` and `set` functions.

- For `get` message, just choose any caller you want to call the contract and choose `get` message from `Message to Send` combobox. It will return the current state of the contract immediately and display the result on the right side.

![call get message](./assets/call-get-message.png)

- For `set` message, you can switch the caller if you want to change the author of the message. Choose `set` message from `Message to Send` combobox, enter the new message you want to set in the `new_message` field, and click on the `Call contract` button.

![call set message](./assets/call-set-message.png)

That's it! You've successfully deployed and interacted with your first ink! smart contract. ðŸŽ‰

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to build a simple smart contract using `ink!`, Polkadot's smart contract language. You set up your development environment, wrote your first smart contract, compiled and deployed it on the local Substrate node, and interacted with it using the `ink!` UI.

This is just the beginning of your journey into the world of decentralized applications on Polkadot. There's so much more to explore and build. I encourage you to dive deeper into the `ink!` documentation and experiment with more complex smart contracts.
